# Howling-Pines
A simplistic website developed as my final project for my introduction to web authoring class.

For this final project I was given two wire frames a some images and had to develope the rest 
of the web site from those. The color pallette, font choice and specifics of implamentation were 
designed by myself.

The CSS code in this repository has been purposly obfuscated as part of the assignment.
