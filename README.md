# Howling-Pines
This is a simplistic website developed as my final project for my Introduction to Web Authoring class.

For this project, I was provided with two wireframes and some images, and I was responsible for developing the rest of the website based on those materials. I designed the color palette, code, font choices, and implementation details myself.

While some aspects of the implementation were required, I had the freedom to determine the specifics.

Please note that the CSS code in this repository has been intentionally obfuscated as part of the assignment.
